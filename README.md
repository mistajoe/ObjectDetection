# ObjectDetection
Hello theree
Detection of frame by frame, could be used for detecting people in
a certain region of interest. Also one step further and it can be
made into a tracker (by keeping history of the objects) setting a
rectangle on masked objects.

using open cv old modules.
Was a nice intro to machine learning and object detection. Watched a series of videos to get this done.
